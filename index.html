        <p class="areatext">
            Saint Lucia is an Eastern Caribbean island nation with a pair of
            dramatically tapered mountains, the Pitons, on its west coast.
            Its coast is home to volcanic beaches, reef-diving sites, luxury
            resorts and fishing villages. Trails in the interior rainforest
            lead to waterfalls like the 15m-high Toraille, which pours over a
            cliff into a garden. The capital, Castries, is a popular cruise port.

        <h2>Santorini</h2>
        <img src="images/Santorini.jpg" id="Santorini">
        <p class="areatext">
            Santorini is one of the Cyclades islands in the Aegean Sea. It was
            devastated by a volcanic eruption in the 16th century BC, forever
            shaping its rugged landscape. The whitewashed, cubiform houses of
            its 2 principal towns, Fira and Oia, cling to cliffs above an underwater
            caldera (crater). They overlook the sea, small islands to the west and
            beaches made up of black, red and white lava pebbles.
